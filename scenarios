1. I want to accept all incoming filters, do not want to add any. Use basic aggreation functions SUM(), MIN(), MAX() etc.
2. I want to accept all incoming filters and add new ones. Use a combination of an "x" function with FILTER, so SUMX(FILTER()), MINX(FILTER()) etc.
3. I want to disable all incoming filters, add none. Use a combination of "x" function with ALL(), so SUMX(ALL()), MINX(ALL()) etc.
4. I want to disable at least one incoming filter and set up an own filter. Use combination of an "x" function with FILTER() and ALL().
SUMX(FILTER(ALL())), MINX(FILTER(ALL())) etc.
